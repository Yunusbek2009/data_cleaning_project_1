ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Project: Financial Transactions Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
In this project, I performed a comprehensive data cleaning process on a raw financial transactions dataset using Python. The original dataset contained a variety of real-world data quality issues such as non-standard formats, inconsistent category labels, and numerical fields stored as strings with unwanted characters.

Rather than deleting flawed data, I approached the task with the mindset that every transaction has potential value, especially in a sales context. I developed custom functions to clean the Quantity and Price columns while preserving as much information as possible. I also standardized textual fields like Payment Method to ensure consistency across categories.

Throughout the notebook, I included modular cleaning steps, intermediate checks, and logical data decisions to reflect the kind of critical thinking expected in real-world data analytics roles. This cleaned dataset is now fully ready for further exploration and visualization in Power BI, where I plan to develop interactive dashboards to uncover insights about payment trends, product sales, and customer behavior.
